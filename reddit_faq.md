# Current State Of Affairs/Quick Questions Thread

Please use the search function before posting a question. Most relevant topics are discussed in the [r/PS4Homebrew Wiki & FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/wiki/index). **Please confine basic questions to this thread. I will update it reasonably often**. Redditors who would like to answer questions will be appreciated, please visit this thread frequently and help us keep the subreddit clean. I will update this post as questions are asked and answered.

If you have a technical question that you feel merits more visibility you may post it in the main subreddit but keep in mind it may be removed and repeatedly doing so may result in further action. Feel free to use modmail to pre-approve technical questions.

## Exploitable Firmware Versions

Currently, there are only 4 firmware versions with publicly available exploits. **Firmware versions above 5.07 are not supported** and are not likely to be for some time. **It is currently not possible to downgrade**. Subscribe and visit frequently for news.

**- 5.05** (5.07 is compatible as well, although it is not common. **Do not update to 5.07**)

**- 4.55** (Updating to 5.05 is recommended as it is the current target for homebrew development.)

**- 4.05** (Updating to 5.05 is recommended as it is the current target for homebrew development.)

**- 1.76** (Version 1.76 and lower may be valuable for research purposes.)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**- How do I know if a console has an exploitable firmware version?** Well, looks like [KiiWii](https://twitter.com/DefaultDNB) has once again heard your pleas and has got you covered, Fam. [PS4IDENT](https://defaultdnb.github.io/PS4IDENT/index.html) is a tool that aims to make identifying PS4's with vulnerable firmware easy. Please check it out, and if you find any of his tools/contributions helpful show your appreciation. The only other way to reliably identify lower firmware consoles is by the particular console bundle. There are various incomplete lists around the internet such as [this GBAtemp thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/suggestion-ps4-bundles-firmware-list.487337/). You will have to do your own footwork, a Google search is a good start though.

**- Can I download/play games for free?** We neither condone nor support piracy. **Any links to pirated material will result in a ban**. Piracy may be discussed in the meta, but any questions regarding where to find pirated materials or how to use them will be removed and could result in a temporary ban.

**- Can I play "X" game? How do I know what firmware a game requires?** If you are wondering about a particular game, check [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game) for the date the game was released. If it is before April 2018, it's more than likely below 5.05 and after April 2018, not playable. If you don't know which game you're looking for and just want to see a list of games that you *can* play, go to [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available/ps4/date), choose "Games" and choose "New Releases" then find "By Platform--> PS4" and then select "[All Releases](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available/ps4/date)" from the bar at the top of the list. It sorts them by date, so you just start checking at April 2018 (which starts on about [page 3](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/release-date/available/ps4/date?page=3) right now). There may be a few small games in May that are playable, and there is a bit of variation over the regions

**- Is there a 5.05+ exploit/When will there be one?** No system is entirely secure. It is a cat and mouse game with security researchers and hackers constantly playing catch-up. As long as interest remains (which is almost certain for the PS4, long past its EOL) newer firmware will be exploited. **If Jailbreaks/HomeBrew are important to you, the golden rule is, do not update.** For more information on firmware 5.5x see this page at [wololo.net](http://wololo.net/2018/05/29/ps4-exploits-the-status-for-5-5x-owners-5-50-5-53-5-55/).

**- Is it possible to downgrade from {my firmware version} to {insert exploitable version here}?**

No. Sorry, it is not possible to downgrade any regular firmware version on a retail console.

**- Is there a Guide?** There are now several guides available both on the wider internet ([LMGTFY](http://bfy.tw/IMMq)) and posted in this subreddit, [this one on GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/aio-ps4-exploit-guide.497858/) seems to be maintained. There is more than one possible method, I recommend [Al-Azif's offline method](https://github.com/Al-Azif/ps4-exploit-host) There are also Android and online hosted solutions as discussed at [PlayStationHax.xyz](https://playstationhax.xyz/forums/topic/4803-three-ways-to-run-the-505-kernel-exploit/).

**- How do I update to 5.05?** Download the relevant file ([available here](https://darksoftware.xyz/PS4/FWlist)) and copy it to a USB drive, then update your console from the downloaded .pup. This is not a tutorial, for detailed instructions see [here](http://wololo.net/2018/05/28/how-to-update-your-ps4-to-firmware-5-05/).

**- Can I play Online still?** You can not access the PlayStation Network without being on the current firmware (5.55). You can [use Linux and access Steam](https://www.psxhax.com/threads/kodi-and-steam-on-ps4-linux-at-4-55-firmware-by-masterzorag.5164/), that may be some consolation.

**- Should I try the â˜†Delete Save Function on my games thumbnail?** [No.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps4homebrew/comments/8mr9e4/dont_do_what_i_did/)

**- What's the difference between Mira and Hen?** HEN means **H**omebrew **EN**abler and is a piece of software that allows your system to run unofficial software (or homebrew).

[The Mira Project](https://github.com/OpenOrbis/mira-project) is a set of tools that grant you more power and control over your jailbroken PlayStation 4. Like HEN, Mira also enables you to run unsigned software but will include other features such as an app store like interface to download homebrew directly from your PS4. So Mira is a homebrew enabler, but HEN is not Mira.

**- Where Can I Get an ESP8266?** These chips are both inexpensive and incredibly common. They're usually around $5-10 USD and a quick search on Amazon, AliExpress, eBay or Google will bring up pages of them. Here is one from [SeeedStudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/NodeMCU-v2-Lua-based-ESP8266-development-kit-p-2415.html) for \~$9.00 USD and one from [GearBest](https://www.gearbest.com/transmitters-receivers-module/pp_366523.html) for less than $4.00 USD as examples.

**- How Can I Help?** I know it may surprise you, but this *is not a* frequently asked question. You can help by subscribing (if you haven\`t already) and becoming part of our community. For those of you who have already subscribed, this subreddit is what we as a community make it. If you see something that is interesting to you regarding PS4 hacks it is likely interesting to most of us as well, so don\`t be afraid to post it. If you learn something new, make a quick post or even better, write a guide.

**Console hacking comes with no guarantees, voids your warranty, breaks Sony's user agreement (EULA) and could even lead to PSN bans. Use at your own risk.**
