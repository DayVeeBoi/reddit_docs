## PS4 Homebrew FAQ

**How do I update safely?**

-All you have to do is download the 5.05 recovery image (one place to do so is DarkSoftware.xyz) place it on a USB device in the following folder tree /PS4/UPDATE/UPDATE.PUP (make sure you change the file name to just "UPDATE.PUP" if you use the darksoftware link).

Put the USB storage into the left-most USB port and start your console in safe mode by turning it off, then once it is off, hold power for around 12-15 seconds until you hear a second beep, then choose option "(3) Update System Software). Make sure that your .pup file is in the correct folder, and is properly named or you may install the wrong update file (I'm not sure if it just errors out or not).

-You would have to disable update blocking through the payload launching menu (if you have blocked updates), then just download the firmware file and update. I would encourage you to download the full ~800mb system image and boot into recovery mode and install it from there.

Some people also recommend you to make a backup of whatever saves etc you care about and then wipe your system to be on the safe side but as it sits nobody has been known to have had any trouble (bans or whatever) due to this exploit.

**How do I find a PS4 with firmware 5.05 or lower?**

You have to find out which bundles come with which firmware. There are a few scattered around on GBAtemp and Wololo.net but IIRC there were not many PS4 Pro bundles on the list. I think FarCry 5, God of War, Destiny 2, and possibly the Gran Turismo 5 VR bundle?

I will post a couple of threads for you, keep in mind that with the PS4 Pro they are still likely making bundles, so it's possible that a bundle that was lower 4.xx in March could now be 5.55 and it also sometimes depends on your region what firmware is shipping.

This should give you a good start anyways, basically if the bundle was shipping before March-April 2018 then it's very likely to be 5.05 and lower. Good Luck!

**Will it ever be possible to play games requiring firmware versions greater than 5.05?**

-It definitely will be possible eventually to play games with minimum FW versions higher than 5.05. What it requires is that decryption for higher versions to become available, this requires some kind of exploit working on whatever version the game happens to require (or for the required keys to be leaked, pretty unlikely).
There are two likely ways this can happen (both are related). One way is that some person (or release group) acquires the ability to dump games (via either exploit or available keys) and they dump and patch the games for release (this may or may not be possible for any given game due to differences in API/SDK).
And of course, the other possible way is via a  public or semi-public jailbreak. This has happened in the past where games with required firmware higher than 4.55 circulated (in a limited way) for a few weeks before 5.05 jailbreak was released.
In summary, I would say if you want to play semi-fresh games for the foreseeable future the only way is to get a second PS4, it doesn't appear to be too hard to find PS4 pro's with <5.05 firmware so personally I have been considering trying to pick one up and updating my current slim. If worst comes to worst and I'm stuck with a Pro that isn't exploitable at least I know it will likely be functional long into the PS4's End of Life period where people are more likely to release exploits (if they are in fact holding onto them). That may change though, given Sony seems to now be releasing security updates long into the EOL of PSP. Who knows, really what you're asking is for someone to tell ya the future. All anyone can do is make an (informed?) guess.

-Maybe someday something previously thought impossible might become possible. Every time a new firmware is released the crypto keys are updated, that's why games with newer required firmware's need a system that's able to play them, to be able to dump them. If you're ever able to play games requiring higher firmware, that almost certainly means there will be a kernel exploit for that higher firmware. Even if it is private, there will eventually be a public one, and as more research gets done the more vulnerabilities are discovered. It just gets more and more likely that the next version gets broken.

**How do I know what games are playable on which firmware?**

-Any game made after about April of this year is unplayable on 5.05. Just find out the date for the games, and you will know. There's no really complete list of minimum required firmware, but there are a few that aren't particularly maintained so the fastest/easiest way is to just check wikipedia (or some game site) for the release date.

In the future, please confine your questions to the sticked "Questions" thread, thanks.
